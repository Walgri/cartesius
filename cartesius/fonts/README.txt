The Oxygen font (Licenced under SIL Open Font License, 1.1 -- http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=OFL) is taken from https://projects.kde.org/projects/playground/artwork/oxygen-fonts

A TrueType font is needed because otherwise PIL can't scale the font to a arbitrary size. It is used for antialiasing.
